# Data Warehouse

A collection of descrite places where data is stored in a structured way and presorted into formats that database software can interact with.

Historically, the only viable solution to the big amount of data the companies collect in different formats and stores in different places was to build a data warehouse: extract data from all those different sources, clean and bring it together, and finally, load this data to polished DWH tables in a well-defined structure.

## Use Cases
Data Warehouse is the go to option for companies that are starting to do data work.

This is also very used for enterprises interested only on descriptive analytics (summarize the data).

## AWS Redshift
AWS Redshift is an example of data warehouse solution optimized for OLAP (online analytical processing).
