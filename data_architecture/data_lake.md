Data Lake is a data architecture based on storing data in its natural form where consumers can go, look at the data, take samples can contain both structured an unstructured data.

The concept behind it is to havee a single data store for all the raw data anyone in the company might need.

On top of the Data Lake there is something called the Data Marketplace, an interface that enables navigation and consumption of the data in the lake.
