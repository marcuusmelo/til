# Intro to Databases


## DBMS: Database Management Systems
- Provides an efficient, reliable, convenient, and safe
multi-user storage of and access to massive
amounts of persistent data.
    - For multi-user access the DBMS relies on concurrency control to guarantee the performance and data safety
    - The DBMS conveniency is based on physical data independency and high -level query langage (declarative)

## Key Concepts:
- Data Models — tells you the general form of data that's going to be stored in the database (ex: set of records, xml, graph)
- Schema vs. Data — in a parallel with programming languages, schemas are like types and data is like variables
- Data Definition Language (DDL) — set up the schema
- Data Manipulation or Query Language (DML) — querying and modifying the database
    
## Key people:
- DBMS Implementer — Builds the system
- Database Designer — Establishes the schema. Can be very challanging
- Database Application Developer — Programs that operate on database
- Database Administrator — Loads data, keeps it running smoothly, tune the parameters. Very important person
