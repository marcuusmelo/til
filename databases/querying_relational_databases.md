# Querying Relational Databases

- Some queries are easy to write, some are harder
- Some queries are easy for the DBMS to execute efficiently, some are harder
- The dificulty to write a query does not correlate with the dificulty for the DBMS to execute it efficiently
- A query over a set of relations (tables) result in a relation (table)
- Query Languages:
    - Relational Algebra: formal (very theoretically based)
    - SQL: actual/Implemented (but based on relational algebra)
