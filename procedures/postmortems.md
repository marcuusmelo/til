# Postmortems

## Learn How to Love Incidents
Incidents and near misses are unfortunate and can be very stressful, but they are also a great learning 
opportunity. Postmortems are a great way to document and share that learning.

## About Postmortems
Having in mind that the more postmortems you have, more learning you and your team will experience, and that
something is better than nothing, when bringing the postmortem culture to your team, you should aim for:
- Lowering the barrier to postmortems: no templates, no fancy text, one sentence if fine. Let up to each developer to define how much time they want to spend there.
- Sharing the knowledge: creating a distribution channel (slack channel automation?) for those postmortems to be read by the team and creating a culture for them to be actually read (retro meeting?)
